This project started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum in July 2015.

It consists of a number of Jupyter Notebooks (iPython / iPy) that produce reports for the senior cubing community. Frequent updates are initiated by Jenkins and the results are pushed to GitHub.

The live website for viewing the Senior Rankings is on [GitHub pages](https://logiqx.github.io/wca-ipy/).
