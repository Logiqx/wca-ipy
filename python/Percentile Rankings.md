# Percentile Rankings

This project started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

The statistics below have been calculated using [aggregated data](sql/extract_senior_aggs.sql) from the WCA database.

Notes:

* "WCA" columns relate to all competitors, regardless of age.
* "Senior" columns relate to all of the Over-40's, based on their age at the start of the competition.
* "Known" columns relate to all of the people in the [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial%20Rankings.md)
