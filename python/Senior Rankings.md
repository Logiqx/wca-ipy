# Representative Over-40's Rankings

This project started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

The rankings below were created from the [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial%20Rankings.md) and [aggregated results](sql/extract_senior_aggs.sql) from the WCA database.

If you would like your name to be added then either contact me via [Speedsolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/members/logiqx.17180/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545).

Notes:

- The private extract was a one-off dating back to 2019-01-30 so the results for unknown seniors are getting stale.
- The private extract was only for official averages so I cannot produce similar rankings for singles, sorry!
