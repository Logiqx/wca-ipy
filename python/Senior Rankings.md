# Representative Over-40's Rankings

This project started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

The rankings below were created from the [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial%20Rankings.md) and [aggregated results](sql/extract_senior_aggs.sql) from the WCA database.
