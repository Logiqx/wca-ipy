## Partial Over-40's Rankings

These are unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community produced from official WCA competition results.

The list of names is incomplete but includes over 10% of the Over-40's. Most of the fastest people are included but a few are known to be missing. If you would like your name to be added then either contact me via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545) or [Speedsolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/members/logiqx.17180/).

A [dynamic page](https://jonatanklosko.github.io/rankings/#/rankings/show?name=Over%2040's%20-%20Official%20PRs&wcaids=) listing personal records is also available but it does not factor in age at the time of the result(s).

Tip: Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
