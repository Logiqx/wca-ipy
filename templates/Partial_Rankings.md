# Partial Over-40's Rankings

![alt text](img/logo.jpg "logo")

This project started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

The list of names is incomplete but includes almost 10% of the Over-40's. Most of the fastest people are included but a few are known to be missing.

If you would like your name to be added then either contact me via [Speedsolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/members/logiqx.17180/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545).

A [dynamic page](https://cubing.mikeg.me.uk/oldies) listing personal records is also available but it does not factor in age at the time of the result(s).

Tip: Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
