## Future Competitions

This page lists future competitions for people in the senior rankings.

It retrieves registration data from [worldcubeassociation.org](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions), [cubingchina.com](https://cubingchina.com/competition), [cubing-tw.net](https://cubing-tw.net/event/), [speedcubing.pl](https://www.speedcubing.pl/) and [cubecomp.de](https://cubecomp.de/). Although the code also supports [zawody4event.pl](https://zawody4event.pl/#competitions) it is unable to connect to the website from my AWS environment.

Tip: Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
