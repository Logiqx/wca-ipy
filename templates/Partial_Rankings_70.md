## Partial Over 70s Rankings

These are unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community produced from official WCA competition results.

The list of names is not yet complete. If you would like your name to be added then please contact me as described on the [front page](/wca-ipy/).

A [dynamic page](https://jonatanklosko.github.io/rankings/#/rankings/show?name=Over%2070s%20-%20Official%20PRs&wcaids=) listing personal records is also available but it does not factor in age at the time of the result(s).

Tip: Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
