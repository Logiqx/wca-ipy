# Percentile Rankings

These are unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community produced from official WCA competition results.

The statistics below have been calculated using anonymised [data](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy/blob/master/sql/extract_senior_aggs.sql) from the WCA database.

Notes:

- "WCA" columns relate to all competitors, regardless of age.
- "Senior" columns relate to all of the Over-40's, based on their age at the start of the competition.
- "Known" columns relate to all of the people in the [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial_Rankings.md).
- The anonymised data was a one-off extract on 2019-02-01 so the results for unknown seniors are getting stale.
- The anonymised data was only for official averages so I cannot produce similar rankings for singles, sorry!
- Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
