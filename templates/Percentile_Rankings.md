## Percentile Rankings

These are unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community produced from official WCA competition results.

The statistics below have been calculated using official data from the WCA database and basic modelling techniques to place the unknown seniors.

Notes:

- "WCA" columns relate to all competitors, regardless of age.
- "Senior" columns relate to all of the over 40s, based on their age at the start of the competition.
- Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
