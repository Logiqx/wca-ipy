# Percentile Rankings

![alt text](img/logo.jpg "logo")

This [project](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy) started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

These unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community are produced from official WCA competition results.

The statistics below have been calculated using anonymised [data](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy/blob/master/sql/extract_senior_aggs.sql) from the WCA database.

Notes:

* "WCA" columns relate to all competitors, regardless of age.
* "Senior" columns relate to all of the Over-40's, based on their age at the start of the competition.
* "Known" columns relate to all of the people in the [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial_Rankings.md).
* The anonymised data was a one-off extract on 2019-02-01 so the results for unknown seniors are getting stale.
* The anonymised data was only for official averages so I cannot produce similar rankings for singles, sorry!

Tip: Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
