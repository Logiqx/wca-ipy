## Indicative Over 40s Rankings

These are unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community produced from official WCA competition results.

This page is the best possible indication that I can provide of your "real" world ranking. Non-contiguous ranks are due to the large number of unlisted seniors. The indicative rankings were created using official data from the WCA database and various modelling techniques to place the missing seniors.

If you would like your name to be added then please contact me as described on the [front page](README.md).

Tip: Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
