# Representative Over-40's Rankings

![alt text](img/logo.jpg "logo")

This [project](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy) started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

These are unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community produced from official WCA competition results.

The rankings below were created from the [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial_Rankings.md) and supplementary anonymised [data](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy/blob/master/sql/extract_senior_aggs.sql) from the WCA database.

If you would like your name to be added then either contact me via [Speedsolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/members/logiqx.17180/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545).

Notes:

- The anonymised data was a one-off extract on 2019-02-01 so the results for unknown seniors are getting stale.
- The anonymised data was only for official averages so I cannot produce similar rankings for singles, sorry!

Tip: Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
