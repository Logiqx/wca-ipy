## Representative Over 40s Rankings

### IMPORTANT
**This page has been superseded by the [Indicative Over 40s Rankings](Indicative_Rankings_40.md)**

**Please view the "Indicate Rankings" using the link above.**

These are unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community produced from official WCA competition results.

The rankings below were created from the [Partial Over 40s Rankings](Partial_Rankings.md) and supplementary anonymised [data](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy/blob/master/sql/extract_senior_aggs.sql) from the WCA database.

If you would like your name to be added then please contact me as described on the [front page](/wca-ipy/).

Notes:

- The anonymised data was a one-off extract on 2019-02-01 so the results for unknown seniors are getting stale.
- The anonymised data was only for official averages so I cannot produce similar rankings for singles, sorry!
- Best viewed in landscape mode on mobile phones and some tablets.
