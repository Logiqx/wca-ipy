<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This project started on the <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/">SpeedSolving.com</a> forum.</p>
<p>The list is far from complete and investigations show that it only covers around 7% of the Over-40's. Most of the fastest people are already included but some are known to be missing. The results below are taken from the WCA database, generated by iPython notebooks.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://cubing.mikeg.me.uk/oldies">dynamic page</a> listing personal records is also available but it does not factor in age at the time of the result(s).</p>
<p>If you would like to be added then either comment to the thread on <a href="https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/">SpeedSolving.com</a> or send me (Logiqx) a PM via the forum.</p>
