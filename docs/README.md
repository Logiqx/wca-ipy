## Senior Rankings

This [project](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy) started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

It provides unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community, produced from official WCA competition results.

**Partial Rankings**
