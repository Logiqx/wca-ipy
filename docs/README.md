## Senior Rankings

This [project](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy) started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

It provides unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community, produced from official WCA competition results. Further information is available in the [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md) and [Privacy Notice](Privacy_Notice.md).

If you would like your name to be added then either contact me via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/michael.george.545) or [Speedsolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/members/logiqx.17180/). To be included in the rankings, I will require your WCA ID and DOB. If you are a member of Speedsolving.com then please provide your nickname as well.
