## Senior Rankings

This [project](https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy) started on the [SpeedSolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/forum/threads/how-fast-are-the-over-40s-in-competitions.54128/) forum.

It provides unofficial rankings for the senior cubing community, produced from official WCA competition results.

Currently available:

* [Partial Over-40's Rankings](Partial_Rankings.md) contains over 10% of the over-40's and has been maintained since 2015
* [Partial Over-50's Rankings](Partial_Rankings_50.md) was introduced in 2019 off the back of the partial over-40's rankings
* [Partial Over-60's Rankings](Partial_Rankings_60.md) was introduced in 2019 off the back of the partial over-50's rankings
* [Partial Over-70's Rankings](Partial_Rankings_70.md) was introduced in 2019 off the back of the partial over-50's rankings
* [Partial Over-80's Rankings](Partial_Rankings_80.md) was introduced in 2019 off the back of the partial over-50's rankings
* [Representative Over-40's Rankings](Senior_Rankings.md) adds anonymised counts to the partial rankings, thus showing all over-40's
* [Percentile Rankings](Percentile_Rankings.md) shows how times are distributed for the WCA community and the over-40's
