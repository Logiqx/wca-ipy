## Legacy Rankings

The rankings on this page are only provided in case the latest rankings do not work on your browser.

I am planning to clean up the project and will remove all of these pages in the near future.

The list of names is still incomplete but most of the fastest people are included (see below). If you would like your name to be added then please contact me as described on the [front page](README.md).
