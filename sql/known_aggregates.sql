    Script:   Aggregated Over 40's Rankings
    Date:     2019-02-07
    Author:   Michael George / 2015GEOR02
   
    Purpose:  Unofficial rankings for the Over-40's exist on GitHub but they are known to be incomplete - https://github.com/Logiqx/wca-ipy.
              This extract will be used to provide participants of the unofficial rankings with a more comprehensive view of how they rank against their peers.
              The data will help us to ascertain how many people are missing from the unofficial rankings and provide general stats for the Over 40's in comp.
            
    Approach: The extract will not disclose any WCA IDs, regardless of whether they already appear in the unoffical rankings on GitHub.
              All consolidated results are modified using truncation / reduction of precision. This is typically to the nearest second.
